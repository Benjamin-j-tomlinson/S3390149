<h2> My Project </h2>
<h3>Building a Game With Unity</h3>
<p> The aim is to create a game using unity, the document also specifies the overview and the general purpose of the game.
 This report also contains information about what tools are implemented in creating the project and the skills required.
 The overview of the game, a survival game to challenge the most ambitious and skilful players to test their limits.
 Every decision in the game will affect not only the player but the entire world, (this sounds a bit cliché’).
</p>
<h3>Overview of the Project</h3>
<p>The game will be a realistic, basic, first/third-person, zombie survival game that will develop over time and incorporate multiplayer attributes.
The player must be self-sufficient and use resources only when necessary, e.g. wood, food and water. Day or night creatures including the zombies will lurk,
in order to survive the player must hunt or avoid them. As the project is to create a unique game using unity or another engine in addition to various tools,
the concept is too large, therefore it will be impossible to complete in the given timeframe. The game will take time to create due to the complexity,
therefore my existing knowledge is insufficient. I will need to develop the skills and knowledge required in programming, animations and various methods of design.
</p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>The motivation for the project, is to create a game that is challenging which captures the interest of a variety of gamers. A game that cannot be easily overcome, overcoming obstacles with the gratification of succeeding. Creating a unique game where countless exist, with new and exciting innovations with VR technologies (eventually), and multiplayer aspects enabling new methods of interaction. Thinking outside of the box and making a new game with attributes that are unique or similar great games will have an enormous impact in the world of gaming.
</p>
<h3> General description of the game </h3>
<p>
	The game will contain many features that extend from resources, objects in the game and the world itself. The game effects the player and what they must do to survive, the player must adapt and be flexible in the approach to a problem. Interactivity with other players and what effect it will have on the game derives from the actions of the players. The enticing environment will vary from suburban cities and small towns to bush and wilderness. The world contains zombies, vicious creatures, NPCs (Non-Player Characters) and other players, not all are friendly. The player will start with essential survival gear, a weapon such as a kitchen knife, a piece of food, one flask of water and one optional piece of equipment. The character can be randomly generated or can be customised to give a unique appearance. The time changes along with seasons, in turn, will affect the weather patterns and the length of the day, night and govern what the player must do. Crafting is critical to the survival of the character, gear can be maintained, upgraded and created to help survival. Foodstuffs and numerous items can be crafted, such as a fire and a shelter from materials the player found. Specifications for crafting will not exist and the player will have to think for themselves.
</p>
<p>
The player will have to find methods to produce or procure food, this can be through means of hunting with the equipment the player has crafted or other methods. Food can also be found, or it can be grown but the food will not last long unless it's packaged or preserved.  The way the food is crafted and the length of time the food will be good for is dependent on the weather and skills used. The weather as the temperature drops or increases will adversely alter health status. Although these obstacles exist there are methods for the player to counteract the effects of the weather conditions or avoid them.
</p>
<p>
	Interacting with the world the player must practice caution to avoid alerting anything to the player location. An instance of this, lighting a fire at night to see but then allowing anything to spot the player within a certain distance if they have a clear line of sight. Noises also affect, crafting shelters, equipment, and materials or even walking close to a target produces noise, alerting anything in the area. The player will be able to gain skills but there is no technical levelling system, this is to challenge the player further by using different techniques to overcome a hurdle. This is representative of a more realistic approach as you can't "level up" in life but gain more skills.
</p>

<p>
	Ultimately players will eventually be able to access more advanced equipment, such as a generator, firearms and padded armour. Vehicles ones that work are rare, parts can be sourced to repair, but these will also be rare and must be used wisely.
</p>
<h3>Tools required for the project</h3>

<p>
	Version control of files, a repository in Git will be created as collaboration is inevitable and sharing assets of the project. Unity uses C# to create scripts to enable more functionality, the limit depends on the programmer. In the unity editor, it contains the tools needed for game development including support for numerous media formats. Unity has its physics engine, settings can be adjusted and modified through scripting enabling complex, realistic physics. Animations and effects can be made through tools built into the unity engine. Unity has an audio tool where files can be manipulated from an imported file and there are numerous visual effects built into the unity editor including the use of Post-Processing to enhance the visuals in the game.
</p>
<h3>Skills required </h3>
<p>
	The feasibility of the concept, it's possible as online tutorials and materials make it simple to develop skills of game development. Programming in C#, the skills can be obtained through practice and learning as various resources are available online. The tools in unity have an associated list of tutorials and documentation for the use of the features in the tools to its potential. Skills required to develop a game are planning each component of a game, developing, updating and maintaining the game. If the game were to be released, marketing and business skills would be needed and may not be possible to develop those skills. Communication and collaboration during the process of developing the game are crucial as third parties will be involved.
</p>
<h3>Outcome </h3>
<p>
	To predict the outcome of a game being successful would be too difficult, if the game were to be created it may be successful but not popular. The game would need to be marketed and sold based on its value and what people would expect to pay. The game would need regular updates and possible content online that can be purchased. This may have an impact as the game would be harsh until the player has more experience with it, it would be challenging which would grab people's attention to see if they can survive. Curious players will also see what is possible in the game and push it to its limits.
</p>
<p>
	The topic covered a basic project, creating a game and what is required in the process including the purpose of the game itself. It is possible to create a basic 2D or 3D game, however it’s not possible to develop the skills and project within the given timeframe due to its complexity. The concept of the game requires expertise in programming, design and various technical competencies. The platform, unity, provides all the tools necessary from animations, audio, integrated physics and scripting, therefore it can be done! As unity is scripted with C# and can also implement VR technologies it would be a useful experience as a step towards VR and game development.
