<p>Hello, my name is Ben Tomlinson, English is my first and only language except for programming, which I’m learning.
I’m a gamer and have been since I was little, this started with mine sweep, solitaire, then moved onto Sponge Bob and Star Wars.
The platforms I use are PC and PlayStation, the innerworkings of a game is what brought my attention to a career in IT. </p>

<h2>My Interest in IT </h2>
<p>  My interest in IT is how software communicates to hardware for processing and completing a task, from receiving input whether through a user or automation, then to output.
  What intrigued me about IT, was watching my dad pull apart his computer and operate without knowing how or why.
  He then gave his old computer to my brother, sisters and I, from then as we didn’t know much about computers and being kids the only thing,
  we could do was to play games. This got me started being a gamer but also my interest in software because I didn’t know what was occurring in the background
  while interacting with it. My experience in IT has mainly been from TAFE, I completed a certificate two and three within a year, while doing this I was dabbling in website development. </p>

<h3 id="title_1">My Motivation to Study</h3>
<img src="20160904_155037.jpg" style="transform: rotate(90deg); width: 60%;" class="sec_img" alt="=board">
<p class="txt">The motive for me to study with RMIT, as I live in South west WA, there are limited avenues for education and work.
I required an institution to provide a flexible and online mode of learning, financial issues influenced my final decision.
I reviewed numerous providers for a suitable degree for IT and the conclusion I came to, was to study with RMIT.
The outcomes I’m expecting to achieve are more knowledge in the area of IT; learning more in-depth concepts of IT,
and requirements of working within the industry. The direction in the field of IT is also what I’m intending to discover that will suit me the most.</p>
